🔹 What is React Fiber?

* React Fiber is the reconciliation engine in React (introduced in React 16).
* It’s a new algorithm for updating the UI in a more efficient, asynchronous, and interruptible way.
* Fiber allows React to:

  * Pause, reuse, or abort work (like rendering)
  * Prioritize updates (urgent like typing > background like animations)
  * Split rendering into chunks → smoother UI

👉 In short: Fiber makes React faster, more responsive, and concurrency-friendly.

# 🔹 Key Concepts of Fiber

1. Fiber Node

   * An object that represents a piece of the UI (a component, DOM node, etc.).
   * Each element in the React tree has a corresponding fiber.

2. Work Units

   * Rendering is broken into small “units of work”.
   * React can pause work after a unit, check for higher priority tasks, and resume later.

3. Phases

   * Render Phase (Reconciliation) → Build the new Fiber tree (can be paused).
   * Commit Phase → Apply changes to the DOM (synchronous, can’t be interrupted).


---------------------------------------------

Reconciliation in React is the process of comparing the new Virtual DOM tree 
with the previous one and then updating the real DOM with only the necessary changes.

    1. React builds a Virtual DOM (a lightweight JS object representing the UI).
    2. When state/props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM.
    3. React then diffs (compares) the new tree with the old one → this process is called Reconciliation.
    4. Finally, React updates only the parts of the real DOM that actually changed.

Reconciliation = Virtual DOM diffing + selective real DOM updates.


--------------------------------------------------------

Hydration in React is the process of attaching React’s event listeners and state to the static 
HTML that was rendered on the server, making it interactive on the client. It prevents React 
from re-rendering the whole UI from scratch and is essential for SSR and frameworks like Next.js.
