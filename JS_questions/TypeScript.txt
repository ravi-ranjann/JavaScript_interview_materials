Q. What are the basic types in TypeScript?

Answer:
string, number, boolean, null, undefined, any, unknown, never, object, void.

Example:- 
let age: number = 30;
let isAdmin: boolean = true;
let notSure: any = "Could be anything";
let value: unknown = "Safe unknown type";

!. What is the difference between any, unknown, and never?

Answer:

any: turns off type checking (unsafe).

unknown: safer alternative to "any", requiring type checks before use.

never: represents values that never occur (e.g., function that throws).

Example:- 
let x: any = 10;       // can be used anywhere
let y: unknown = 10;   // must check before using
function fail(msg: string): never {
  throw new Error(msg);
}

Q. What are interfaces in TypeScript? How are they different from types?

Answer:

interface: defines object shape and can be extended/merged.

type: can represent primitives, unions, intersections.

Example:- 
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

type Role = "admin" | "user";

Q. What are enums in TypeScript? When would you use them?

Answer:
Enums are used to define a set of named constants.

Example:- 
enum Status {
  Pending,
  InProgress,
  Done
}

let task: Status = Status.Done;

Q. What are type aliases? Give an example.

Answer:
A type alias gives a name to a type.

Example:- 
type ID = string | number;
let userId: ID = 42;

Q. What is the difference between interface and type?

Answer:

interface: extendable, supports declaration merging.

type: more flexible (can do unions, intersections, primitives).

Example:- 
interface A { x: number; }
interface A { y: number; }  // merged ✅

type B = { x: number };
// type B = { y: number }; ❌ cannot redeclare

Q. What are generics in TypeScript? Can you give an example?

Answer:
Generics make components reusable by working with multiple types.

Example:- 
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

let num = identity<number>(10); // T = number
let str = identity("hello");    // T = string

Q. How do you use utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, Readonly, Record?

Answer:
They transform types.

Example:- 
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;   // all props optional
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>; // all props readonly
type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;
type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, "email">;
type UserRoles = Record<"admin" | "guest", User>;
