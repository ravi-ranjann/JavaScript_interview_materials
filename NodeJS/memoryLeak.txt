A memory leak happens when an app keeps holding references to objects/data 
that are no longer needed, so the garbage collector (GC) can’t free them.

Causes
1. Not adding clearInterval after using setInterval.
2. Not Closing Database Connections
3. Using Global Variables
4. Unresolved Promises (return new Promise(() => {}); // never resolves/rejects)

Preventions

✅ Use --inspect or Chrome DevTools to track memory usage.
✅ Use monitoring tools: clinic, pm2, heapdump.
✅ Always clear timers & listeners when not needed.
✅ Use connection pooling for DB.
✅ Limit cache size (LRU, Redis).
✅ Handle promise rejections properly.
✅ Run load tests + observe memory growth over time.
